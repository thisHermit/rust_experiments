# Vibe Coding With Friends ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦€  

## The AI Codes, We Just Chill  

No more stress, no more grind,  
AI writes the code, we just unwind.  
With Rust in place and vibes so tight,  
We speak our dreamsâ€”AI makes them right.  

No `segfaults`, no `nulls`, no pain,  
Just flawless logic, AI-trained.  
The borrow checker? It plays along,  
Fixing bugs while we play a song.  

"Hey AI, make this app run fast,"  
A few keystrokes, and itâ€™s done at last.  
From structs to crates, from async to sync,  
AI handles it allâ€”we barely blink.  

We sip our drinks, we laugh, we chill,  
The AI codes, obeying our will.  
Rust stays strong, ownership tight,  
We do nothing, yet ship overnight.  

So raise a toast to this coding dream,  
AI does the workâ€”we lead the team.
