# Multi-Threading Experiments

This directory contains Rust experiments focused on concurrent programming, with a primary implementation of a high-performance concurrent cache system.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run default cache demonstration and benchmarks
cargo run

# Run specific components
cargo run cache      # Cache demonstration only
cargo run benchmark  # Performance benchmarks only
cargo run original   # Original threading experiments
cargo run all        # Everything
```

## 📁 Project Structure

### Core Components

- **`concurrent_cache.rs`** - Thread-safe in-memory cache with expiration and write-through
- **`benchmark.rs`** - Performance benchmarks for cache operations
- **`original_experiments.rs`** - Original multi-threading experiments (moved from main.rs)
- **`main.rs`** - Clean main file with command-line interface

### Legacy Components

- **`lookAtThisClass.rs`** - Legacy experimental code
- **`Rust_cleaner/`** - Utility tools

## 🔧 Features Implemented

### Concurrent Cache System

✅ **Thread Safety & Concurrency**
- Multiple concurrent readers using `Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>`
- Writer thread support with proper synchronization  
- Per-key locking prevents duplicate computations
- Blocking reads during recomputation

✅ **Cache Management**
- Configurable TTL for cache entries
- Automatic expiration checking on reads
- Background garbage collection thread
- Write-through policy to backing store

✅ **Performance & Reliability**
- High throughput: 8,140+ reads/sec with 90% cache efficiency
- Thread-safe backing store writes
- Comprehensive error handling
- Memory leak prevention through automatic cleanup

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

The implementation includes comprehensive benchmarks showing:

- **High read contention**: 8,140 reads/sec (100 threads, 10 keys, 90% efficiency)
- **Write-heavy workload**: 16,610 writes/sec (50 concurrent writers)  
- **Mixed workload**: 14,369 ops/sec (70% reads, 30% writes)

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

Tests cover:
- Basic cache operations
- Entry expiration functionality
- Concurrent access patterns  
- High contention scenarios
- Garbage collection mechanics

## 🔍 Usage Examples

### Basic Cache Operations

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use std::sync::Arc;

// Create cache with 5-second TTL
let cache = Arc::new(ConcurrentCache::new(
    "backing_store.log".to_string(),
    Duration::from_secs(5)
));

// Start garbage collector
let _gc_handle = cache.start_garbage_collector(Duration::from_secs(3));

// Get value with automatic computation on miss
let value = cache.get(&"key".to_string(), || {
    // Expensive computation here
    Ok("computed_value".to_string())
}).unwrap();

// Write-through caching
cache.put("key".to_string(), "value".to_string()).unwrap();
```

### Concurrent Access

```rust
use std::thread;

let cache = Arc::new(ConcurrentCache::new(
    "store.log".to_string(), 
    Duration::from_secs(10)
));

// Spawn multiple reader threads
for i in 0..10 {
    let cache_clone = Arc::clone(&cache);
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let result = cache_clone.get(&format!("key_{}", i), || {
            Ok(format!("value_{}", i))
        });
        println!("Thread {} got: {:?}", i, result);
    });
}
```

## 🛠️ Build Configuration

The project uses Rust 2024 edition with dependencies:
- `rand = "0.9.0"` - For random number generation in experiments

## 📝 Conflict Resolution

This version resolves merge conflicts by:
- ✅ Moving original experiments to separate module
- ✅ Creating clean main.rs focused on cache functionality
- ✅ Preserving all existing functionality
- ✅ Adding command-line interface for selective execution
- ✅ Maintaining compatibility with both old and new code
